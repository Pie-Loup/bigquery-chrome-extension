# 🚀 Chrome Web Store Publishing Guide

## Step 1: Prepare Your Extension

### ✅ 1.1 Create Required Icons
You need to create 3 icon sizes from your `favicon.png`:

├── icon-48.png   (48x48px) 
└── icon-128.png  (128x128px)
```

**Tools for icon creation:**
- Online: [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) or [Canva](https://canva.com)
- Desktop: GIMP, Photoshop, or Figma
- Mac: Preview (resize function)

### ✅ 1.2 Test Your Extension
```bash
# Test in Chrome:
1. Go to chrome://extensions/
2. Enable "Developer mode"
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select your chrome-extension/ folder
5. Test all features in BigQuery
```

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### ❌ **"Manifest validation failed"**
- Check manifest.json syntax
- Ensure all required fields present
- Verify permissions are necessary

### ❌ **"Icon missing or invalid"**
- Create proper PNG icons (16, 48, 128px)
- Check file paths in manifest.json
- Ensure icons are not corrupted

### ❌ **"Deceptive installation tactics"**
- Avoid misleading descriptions
- Be clear about extension functionality
- Don't promise features you don't have

### ❌ **"Excessive permissions"**
- Only request necessary permissions
- Your extension only needs `activeTab` and `storage` ✅

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **SEO Keywords**: Include "BigQuery", "SQL", "Query", "Execute" in description
2. **User Support**: Create GitHub Issues for support requests  
3. **Versioning**: Use semantic versioning (1.0.0, 1.0.1, etc.)
4. **Testing**: Test on different BigQuery accounts/themes
5. **Documentation**: Keep README.md updated for developers
